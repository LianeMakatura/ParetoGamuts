Pareto Gamuts: Exploring Optimal Designs Across Varying Contexts
SIGGRAPH 2021

# Running the visualizer
The JS visualizer (shown in the video) comes pre-loaded with all necessary data to recreate the examples in our paper.
The visualizer is best used in Chrome. It does not work in Safari.

The visualizer is interactive or nearly interactive for all problems once it's loaded; loading may take a few seconds.
The turbine is not quite interactive because of the large amount of data and semi-intensive jscad model; it takes a few seconds to update between point selections. 

## Set up docker
First, you will need to set up a jscad server for the on-the-fly mesh generation.
We provide simple instructions in `./jscad-server`

## Selecting a problem
You can toggle between the problems by (un)commenting lines in `vis/js/settings.js`

## Launching the visualizer
We recommend using VSCode with the LiveServer extension; simply hit "Go Live" in the bottom right corner to start the viewer (and copy the link to chrome if that's not your default browser)

## Using the interface
You can select points to examine from any 2D design or performance plot (not 3D).
To view multiple designs simultaneously, press Control. To go back to single design mode, press control.
To download a mesh, use `d`
